## 🚀 Project Overview

> “A well-oiled SOC is not just about technology – it's about people, processes, and continuous improvement.”

This project is designed to:
- Provide **minute-level details** of each phase in a SOC workflow.
- Serve as a **learning hub** for blue teamers and cyber defenders.
- Help organizations structure and refine their **SOC processes**.
- Deliver **sample playbooks**, real-world tools, and proven response models.

Built upon best practices from **NIST**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, **SANS**, and **CISA**, this repository is your go-to resource for understanding how modern SOCs function in 2025 and beyond.

## 🏗️ SOC Architecture

An effective SOC includes:

- Tiered Analyst Structure: **L1 (Monitoring)**, **L2 (Analysis)**, **L3 (Threat Hunting/Response)**
- Core Components: **SIEM, SOAR, Threat Intel, EDR, NDR, UEBA**
- Deployment Models: **On-Prem**, **Hybrid**, **Cloud-Native SOC**
- Communication Channels: **Ticketing systems, war rooms, and escalation protocols**

> 📊 Visual diagrams and architecture models coming soon!
